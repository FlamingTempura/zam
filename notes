* tests:
  * examples folder
  * $off
  * other events (create, destroy)

* global/root scopes not proxied (so can't react to changes)

<div z-exist="blah" z-transition></div>
<div z-thing-in="blah" z-key="blah.yo"></div>



Transitions:

* z-enter: Starting state for enter. Added before element is inserted, removed one frame after element is inserted.

* z-enter-active: Active state for enter. Applied during the entire entering phase. Added before element is inserted, removed when transition/animation finishes. This class can be used to define the duration, delay and easing curve for the entering transition.

* z-enter-to: Only available in versions >=2.1.8. Ending state for enter. Added one frame after element is inserted (at the same time v-enter is removed), removed when transition/animation finishes.

* z-leave: Starting state for leave. Added immediately when a leaving transition is triggered, removed after one frame.

* z-leave-active: Active state for leave. Applied during the entire leaving phase. Added immediately when leave transition is triggered, removed when the transition/animation finishes. This class can be used to define the duration, delay and easing curve for the leaving transition.

* z-leave-to: Only available in versions >=2.1.8. Ending state for leave. Added one frame after a leaving transition is triggered (at the same time v-leave is removed), removed when the transition/animation finishes.



bug?:
<div><div></div> {{ doo }}</div>
 => <div><div>blah</div></div>

 e.g. in test.html
 <div z-p-in="ps">
    {{ p }}
        <div>Done</div>
  </div>
